    reservations.

    A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the
    form of `slots <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots>`__, to
    users. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and
    serves as the basic unit of parallelism. In a scan of a
    multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates on a single
    partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
    resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName``.

    A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for
    BigQuery jobs (in the form of slots) with some committed period of
    usage. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child resource of
    the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id``.

        have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination,

        type.

        Different assignments can be created on different levels of the

        and organization levels in that order. The first assignment

        When creating assignments, it does not matter if other
        assignments exist at higher levels.

        "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment.
        Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a
        "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent.
